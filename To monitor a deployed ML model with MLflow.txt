To monitor a deployed ML model with MLflow, you’ll need to set up MLflow Tracking to log metrics, predictions, and other relevant data generated during inference. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how to use MLflow for monitoring an inference model that is already deployed.
1. Set Up MLflow Tracking Server
* If MLflow Tracking Server is not yet configured, set it up on your on-premise infrastructure.
* You can run MLflow Tracking as a standalone server with a backend database (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) and an artifact store (e.g., a file system).
* Start the tracking server by running:
bash
Copy code
mlflow server --backend-store-uri <database-uri> --default-artifact-root <artifact-storage-uri> --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
2. Configure the Model for Logging with MLflow
* Update your inference code to log predictions, input features, and any additional performance metrics to MLflow.
* Set the MLflow tracking URI to the address where the MLflow Tracking Server is running:
python
Copy code
import mlflow
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
3. Log Model Predictions and Metrics in Inference Code
* Modify the deployed model’s inference pipeline to log predictions and input data at runtime. This typically involves:
o Input Features: Log input features for monitoring data drift.
o Predictions: Log predictions to track the model's output over time.
o Custom Metrics: Log metrics such as accuracy, latency, and errors to monitor model performance.
* Here’s an example of logging these values using MLflow:
python
Copy code
import mlflow

# Wrap inference code to log data and predictions
def predict_and_log(model, input_data):
    # Start a new MLflow run
    with mlflow.start_run():
        # Record the input data (be cautious with large inputs for storage reasons)
        mlflow.log_params({"input_data": input_data})

        # Get the model's prediction
        prediction = model.predict(input_data)

        # Log the prediction
        mlflow.log_metric("prediction", prediction)

        # Additional metrics
        inference_time = calculate_inference_time()
        mlflow.log_metric("inference_time", inference_time)

    return prediction
4. Monitor Drift by Logging Input Features
* Regularly log the input data features or summaries (such as mean, standard deviation) to track data drift over time.
* By examining feature distribution changes in MLflow, you can detect shifts in the data used during inference, which could impact model accuracy.
* Example:
python
Copy code
import numpy as np

def log_feature_statistics(input_data):
    mlflow.log_metric("input_mean", np.mean(input_data))
    mlflow.log_metric("input_stddev", np.std(input_data))
5. Track and Visualize Performance Over Time in MLflow UI
* Use the MLflow UI to observe logged metrics, input distributions, and predictions over time. This allows you to identify patterns, trends, or anomalies in the model’s behavior.
* Set alerts based on specific metrics or thresholds within MLflow or using a custom script to regularly check metrics for unusual values.
6. Comparing Model Versions for Performance Degradation
* If you update your model, MLflow allows you to log different model versions, making it easier to compare performance metrics between versions.
* You can use these comparisons to check for issues like accuracy degradation or data drift, indicating when retraining may be necessary.
7. Automate Logging and Alerting (Optional)
* If you want to automate this monitoring, you can write a script or cron job that checks MLflow metrics and sets up alerts when certain thresholds are exceeded.
* For example, if the accuracy falls below a threshold or latency goes above a limit, an alert can be triggered.
Example Workflow for Monitoring
Here’s a possible flow of steps to monitor inference with MLflow in production:
1. Inference: As predictions are made, log inputs, outputs, and other metrics in MLflow.
2. Drift Detection: Track summary statistics of input features to detect drift over time.
3. Performance Monitoring: Observe response time, errors, or other latency metrics that indicate the model's health.
4. Comparative Analysis: Use version tracking in MLflow to identify if performance degradation happens in newer models.
Example of an Inference Monitoring Code Block
Here’s a consolidated example code for monitoring inference using MLflow:
python
Copy code
import mlflow
import numpy as np

def monitor_inference(model, input_data):
    mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")

    with mlflow.start_run():
        # Log input features statistics
        mlflow.log_metric("input_mean", np.mean(input_data))
        mlflow.log_metric("input_stddev", np.std(input_data))

        # Perform prediction and log it
        prediction = model.predict(input_data)
        mlflow.log_metric("prediction", prediction)

        # Log custom metrics (e.g., inference latency)
        inference_time = calculate_inference_time()
        mlflow.log_metric("inference_time", inference_time)

    return prediction
By following these steps and leveraging MLflow’s UI, you can gain insights into model performance, detect data drift, and troubleshoot issues for an on-premise deployed model.
