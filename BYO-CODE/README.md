# Machine Learning Repository: Templates and Applications

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Repository**! This repository is designed to serve as a resource for modelers and developers by providing reusable **Machine Learning Pipeline Templates** and ready-to-use **PNC Machine Learning Applications**.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

### 1. `Modele-template`
This folder contains **Machine Learning Pipeline Templates** that provide reusable starting points for building machine learning models. It is further divided into subfolders based on popular ML frameworks:

#### Subfolders:
- **`Scikit-Learn/`**: Templates for building machine learning pipelines using Scikit-Learn.
- **`XGBoost/`**: Templates tailored for XGBoost-based pipelines.
- **`PyTorch/`**: Templates for deep learning models using PyTorch.
- **`TensorFlow/`**: Templates for TensorFlow-based machine learning pipelines.
- **`Envconfig/`**: Configuration and setup files for creating the appropriate environment for each framework.

### 2. `PNC-ML-Applications`
This folder contains ready-to-use **PNC Machine Learning Applications**, developed to solve real-world problems and implement practical solutions using machine learning.
